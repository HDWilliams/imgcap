# Image Storage Gallery with Vector Search
An image gallery to allow searching images by content and photo compositional techniques. Current version only contains search by content.
Once images are uploaded AWS Rekognition api creates labels for image content. These labels are then given to OPenAi embeddings api to create vector embeddings that power image search.
